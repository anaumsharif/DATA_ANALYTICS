# DATA_ANALYTICS

Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information.
Data analytics help a business optimize its performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions.
The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption. 
Various approaches to data analytics include looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics).
Data analytics relies on a variety of software tools including spreadsheets, data visualization, reporting tools, data mining programs, and open-source languages for the greatest data manipulation.

Types of Data Analytics
Data analytics is broken down into four basic types:

Descriptive analytics: This describes what has happened over a given period of time. Have the number of views gone up? Are sales stronger this month than last?
Diagnostic analytics: This focuses more on why something happened. It involves more diverse data inputs and a bit of hypothesizing. Did the weather affect beer sales? Did that latest marketing campaign impact sales?
Predictive analytics: This moves to what is likely going to happen in the near term. What happened to sales the last time we had a hot summer? How many weather models predict a hot summer this year?
Prescriptive analytics: This suggests a course of action. We should add an evening shift to the brewery and rent an additional tank to increase output if the likelihood of a hot summer is measured as an average of these five weather models and the average is above 58%,
